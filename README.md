# Concepts_Of_Stats_1
### Course Description: 
Distribution of random variables, conditional probability and
independence, distributions of functions of random variables, and limiting distributions
are discussed.

### Learning Outcomes
#### Course Student Learning Outcomes
1. Use statistical software, like R, to solve complex statistical problems.
2. Relate concepts of probability theory to statistics.
3. Use random variables, probability distributions, and mathematical expectation to
solve real-world statistical applications.
4. Identify various discrete and continuous probability distributions.
5. Apply sampling techniques.
6. Estimate values and perform hypothesis testing

#### Program Student Learning Outcomes
1. Apply the tools of calculus, linear algebra, optimization, probability and statistics
to identify likely characteristics and trends buried in large data sets so that
reasonable conclusions about the data may be drawn.
2. Write software that implements the mathematical techniques required to extract
meaning from large data sets, primarily using off-the-shelf mathematical software
tools.
3. Choose appropriate data science techniques for solving problems in disciplines
that produce accurate, timely insights from large quantities of data.

#### Baccalaureate Characteristics/Graduate Student Learning Outcomes
1. Synthesize theoretical and research concepts from multiple perspectives to
inform inquiry and practice.
2. Formulate creative responses to complex issues through critical analysis.
